   - Description: Make an outbound call to a specified phone number.
   - Parameters:
     - `phone_number` - The phone number to call.

## Future Events
- Understand the user's description of future events from the transcript.
- Use the `current_date_time()` function to compare the current time with the user's specified time.
- If the times match, use the `make_outbound_call()` function to make the outbound call.

## Example Workflow
1. Her assistant gets the transcripts and extracts the event details and time.
2. The assistant uses the `current_date_time()` function to get the current time.
3. If the current time matches the event time, the assistant uses the `make_outbound_call()` function to make the outbound call using the user phone number, the prompt_preamble, the agent type and agent name.
